    malformed one (observed in the wild: a Plejd device whose id string was
    stored as many single-character elements). Bermuda unpacked every
    identifier directly, so such a device raised
    ``ValueError: too many values to unpack`` and broke the entire
    ``device_registry_updated`` handler on every registry change.

    The handler must skip malformed identifiers, still process valid ones,
    and run to completion.

    Regression test: the copy loops used to iterate `source_device.items()`

    dict storage (state lives entirely in instance attributes), so
    `.items()` was always empty and this whole block was a silent no-op -
    metadevices never picked up their source's name/manufacturer/beacon
    fields through this path. `val is any([...])` was also broken on its
